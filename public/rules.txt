Your goal is to progress to as high of a level as possible. Once you progress to a new level, a new rule is added.
Breaking any rule will result in you losing the game and having to restart.
A and B should be positive integers.
A ≠ B/2
A ≠ B, unless A = 2
A + (R2) <= B + (R1)
A + B^2 > (R4)
A or B cannot be in the negative zone for more than (R6) button presses.
